# Resume-Extension

This is a WIP project that acts as a chrome extension. A window will pop up prompting a user to upload their resume and paste the job description into a text box. An AI NLP program will then analyze the skills of the applicant compared to the job description and return a list of missing skills, encouraging the user to edit their resume to better fit the job.
